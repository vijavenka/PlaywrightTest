# PlaywrightTest
Playwright UI &amp; API automation

# Design pattern: POM
# Easy Maintenance: 
  In web automation, everything depends on the DOM tree and selectors. The page object model makes maintenance easier even if there is a change in the DOM tree and selectors we donâ€™t have to modify everywhere. 
# Increased Reusability: 
  Using POM, we can reuse the code which is written for another test. Also, we can create custom helper methods to achieve this. Code Reusability reduces the code, thus saving time and effort.
# Readability: 
  As the tests are independent, it increases the readability

# Folder structure:
|/pageobjects/
|/pageobjects/HomePage/
|/pageobjects/ExploreCar/
|/tests/
|/tests/api/
|/tests/api/ApiNetworkTest.spec/
|/tests/ui/
|/tests/ui/PolestarTest.spec/
|/utils/
|/utils/ApiGorest.spec/
|/utils/ApiReqres.spec/
